# Secret NFTs as Asset-Backed Security collateralized with Virtual keys (or smart locks)

Love to have a talk about somewhat a new use case of Secret NFTs.
No idea whether here is a good place or not though.
Please leave a comment if you're somehow interested.
Will be glad. :D


## Tokenizing real assets is really challenging.
Banksy has burnt his work before tokenizing it.
Drawings may be valuable even if it is burnt, but burning houses, vehicles, ... is nothing but insane behavior.
Since houses, vehicles, ships, planes, ... are valuable only if they are existing and functioning.
The nature of difficulty with tokenization is to keep its availability while it is secured.


The solution I'm thinking about is:
placing trusted parties who can suspend the asset's effect, the asset-backed NFTs can be more trusted.
If availability status can be managed in Secret NFTs' contract as well as ownership, Secret NFTs can cover wider assets.


## Preliminary

There is conventional (somewhat new) finance scheme in which smart locks (virtual keys) play a role.

It works like below:

### Problem
A consumer wants to buy a new vehicle, but no enough money and not qualified for auto loan.
Getting qualified for auto loan is sometimes difficult because morgage is not considered always applicable to automobile since its debtor can run away with it.

### Solution
Authorize creditor's virtual key to lock car's door & engine.
If repayment is not done accordingly, creditor can suspend the functionality of the car.
That means car holder can't run away with it - creditor can seize the asset.
That being said, morgage is applicable to automobile in a better way.


## Secret NFTs with availability status

I believe Secret NFTs can consolidate the ownership and status of asset.
Ownership and status should be private information.
They are financial affairs of somebody or company.


The way of deactivation really depends on type of the asset.

### Example
* Cars can be (mostly) suspended by virtual key features.
* Solar panels can be suspended by control over power transmission.

On the other hand, availability information can be generalized to some extent.


## Wrap-up
* Virtual keys (smart locks) can be one of collateralization method of NFTs.
* As well-known, Secret NFTs can manage and keep secrets attached with the assets (ownership and availability status).
* Secret NFTs can keep the privacy and seal the function.

I'm at the very entrance point of Secret NFTs world, so still not sure about feasibility.
If there is any technical challenge, please give me your advice.
Thank you.
